    <h2>Causes of Athlete Burnout</h2>
    <ul>
     <p>One of the main causes for an athlete burnout is overtraining. When athletes have little to no recovery time and are pushed to their limit, their body, mental, and mind become to tire out. This happening over and over can lead to exhaustion, injury, and a lack of motivation to continue performing. When it comes to high expectations from coaches, parents, and or fans it can also cause a lot of pressure. Athletes will feel that they always have to succeed or perform perfectly. This can cause a bunch of stress and will make burnouts more likely to happen. Also, athletes will start to fear failure instead of just having fun. One of the big factors and usually overlooked is the lack of control athletes often feel. Almost all athletes have a set schedule where they are told where to be, when to train, and what goals to aim for. It gives athletes no say in their own goals. This can lead to frustration and the feeling of being trapped.
