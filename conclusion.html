    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Athlete burnout is a very important problem which can be caused by overtraining, pressure, and not having control over personal things. All of those things and more can cause emotional and physical exhaustion and even lead to long term mental health issues. However, a burnout doesnt mean it's the end of an athlete's journey. With all the good strategies like scheduling, having a support person or group, and stopping a burnout early, a burnout can be prevented all together. Understanding athlete burnouts matter. It lets us support athletes as normal people and when an athlete is mentally and physically healthy they do so much better in their sport while also keeping that love they had and most importantly, having fun. </p>
