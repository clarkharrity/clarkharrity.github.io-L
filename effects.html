    <h2>Effects of Burnout</h2>
    <ul>
      <p>One of the main effects of burnouts is the feeling or being super tired and having no motivation. Athletes who once loved their sport may no longer enjoy playing. That excitement to play and the love they have for the sport can fade away making athletes want to quit. One of the easy effects to see is a player's performance starts to suffer. A burned out athlete might stop getting better and also might start getting worse. Players are more likely to get hurt and have a hard time staying focused at practices which can cause worsen play. Another thing to think about is if burnout also makes school harder. If an athlete is tired and stressed just from their sport, imagine what it could do to their school work. For example, it might lead to worse grades and problems focusing in class. When it comes to a player's mental health, a burnout can cause bad stress, depression, and anxiety. If an athlete is under a lot of pressure to perform good and let's say they don't, it can have a huge impact on their overall mental health and how they feel about the sport in the future.</p>
