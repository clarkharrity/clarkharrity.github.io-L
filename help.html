    <h2>Getting Help</h2>
    <ul>
      <p>It is very important to see the early signs of a burnout. When an athlete who is usually always tired, gets frustrated, and seems like they are losing love for the sport may be experiencing the start of a burnout. Seeing these signs at the start helps them when it comes to recovering fast and avoiding any serious problems. The most important thing to do is talk to someone, it can really be the deciding factor. It can be a coach, friend, family member, teacher, anyone who will listen and support no matter what. It can help an athlete feel heard and understood. It's always important to remember that reaching out is not a sign of weakness, it's the best way to protect and prevent your mental and emotional health from getting worse. </p>
