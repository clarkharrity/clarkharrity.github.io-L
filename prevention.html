      <p>To help prevent burnouts its important to create a schedule. An athlete needs their alone time and time with friends while also having time to rest both physically and mentally. Having downtime will help with avoiding overtraining and keep their love for the sport. Having a strong support system makes a huge difference. When an athlete has coaches, parents, and friends who check in and cheer them on no matter what, it helps make them feel more secure and less alone knowing you have someone to turn to. Having this support can help manage pressure way more easily. A super important factor is letting athletes have a say in any training and goals. For example, giving athletes options for when they want to train. A coach could set up 3 training times throughout the day and letting them pick which one they want to go to can help and give athletes the sense of control. When an athlete feels heard they tend to stay more engaged and motivated to get better.    </p>
